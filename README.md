# Data Process Modeler - Examples

These repository contains example files to use with the dpm project.
Model files should be placed into the src/models (for Development) and public/models (for Release) directories. 
After publishing to - for example - /var/www/htdocs place or update the model files there:

    /var/www/htdocs/models/detailed-model.json
    /var/www/htdocs/models/simple-model.json            

Done!
